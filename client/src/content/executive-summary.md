# Generative Artificial Intelligence Models for Medical Imaging SaaS

## Executive Summary

Medical imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI, pathology) is essential to clinical diagnostics. Hardware advances rapidly, with pixel size improvements from ~500 µm to ~50 µm over ~25 years, creating pressure on centers with 10–15 year equipment lifecycles.

OEM SaaS can help, but lock-in and varying quality remain challenges. **OEM-agnostic GenAI SaaS** offers a path to upgrade image quality without immediate capital expenditure.

## Market Challenge

Healthcare systems face immense pressure from rapidly advancing imaging technology. With equipment lifecycles spanning 10-15 years and imaging technology improving dramatically every few years, providers must choose between significant capital investments or accepting suboptimal image quality. Traditional OEM upgrade paths often lead to vendor lock-in and inconsistent quality standards.

## Technology Solution

Our GenAI-powered platform provides immediate image quality upgrades for existing equipment through advanced super-resolution and enhancement algorithms. By supporting all major OEM systems and maintaining vendor neutrality, we enable healthcare providers to optimize their imaging workflows while preserving their existing infrastructure investments.

## Use Cases

### X-Ray Super-Resolution
Transform legacy computed radiography (~200 µm) to digital radiography equivalent quality (~50 µm) through AI enhancement. Preserve diagnostic fidelity while reducing hardware upgrade pressure through pay-per-use, OEM-agnostic implementation.

### CT Super-Resolution & Enhancement
Legacy 4/16-slice systems (~2–3 mm slice thickness) can achieve ~0.5 mm slice thickness and spatial resolution, with quality comparable to modern 256/320-slice systems. Scalable to 512/640-slice equivalent quality at a fraction of the capital expenditure through cloud or hybrid deployment.

### MRI Super-Resolution & Enhancement
1.5T fast scans (~5×5×5 mm voxel size) can be enhanced to ~0.5×0.5×0.5 mm 3T/5T/7T-like quality. Maintain SNR and anatomical integrity with physics-informed priors while achieving throughput gains through shorter scan times combined with post-acquisition enhancement.

### Digital Re-Staining for WSI (Pathology)
Predict alternative stain protocols digitally (cytology, histology, IHC) to reduce multi-stain costs and enable re-analysis of archived slides. Patient-centric approach ensures digital ownership and portability of pathology data.

## Technical Approach

### Generative AI Architecture
Deep Neural Networks combined with adversarial learning for superior image enhancement and super-resolution capabilities. Transformer-based encoder-decoder networks with multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms for detail preservation.

### Physics-Informed Loss Functions
Respects modality-specific constraints and physical principles to ensure clinically accurate results. Loss functions incorporate domain knowledge about imaging physics, noise characteristics, and anatomical structures.

### OEM-Agnostic Training
Harmonization algorithms ensure consistent performance across different imaging equipment manufacturers. Cross-vendor training datasets and domain adaptation techniques eliminate vendor-specific biases.

### Quality Assurance Framework
Built-in quality assurance with uncertainty quantification and automated QA overlay generation. Comprehensive validation frameworks ensure clinical reliability and radiologist confidence.
