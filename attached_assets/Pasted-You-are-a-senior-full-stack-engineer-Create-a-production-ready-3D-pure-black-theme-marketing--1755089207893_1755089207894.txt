## Global Design Requirements
- **Pure black UI**: `bg-black text-zinc-200`, cards `bg-zinc-900/60` with subtle borders `border-zinc-800`, glassy surfaces using `backdrop-blur`.
- **Radiologist vibe**: thin gridlines, monospace readouts (for pixel sizes, slice thickness), subtle scanline shader in hero.
- Motion: tasteful, 60fps; reduced motion preference respected.
- Accessibility: WCAG AA, keyboard nav, proper roles/aria, focus rings visible on black.

## Home Page (marketing + 3D hero)
- Hero: full-bleed 3D gantry rotating slowly with luminous scan arc; headline:
  - H1: “OEM-Agnostic GenAI for Medical Imaging”
  - Sub: “Super-resolution and enhancement for X-Ray, CT, MRI, and Digital Pathology — as a Service.”
  - CTAs: “See Live Demos” (anchor to `/demos`) and “Talk to Us”
- Stat strip (animated counters):
  - “Up to 4× spatial upscaling (X-ray)”
  - “Down to 0.5 mm slice equivalent (CT)”
  - “0.5 mm³ voxel equivalence (MRI)”
- Logos row (placeholders)
- Feature grid (cards linking to sections below)

## Solutions Page (pull copy from provided text, rewritten into crisp web sections)
Create 4 sections with concise bullets and “Learn More” deep-dives:

1) **X-Ray Imaging Super-Resolution**
   - From ~200 µm CR → ~50 µm DR-equivalent via GenAI SaaS
   - Preserve diagnostic fidelity; reduce hardware upgrade pressure
   - Pay-per-use; OEM-agnostic

2) **CT Imaging Super-Resolution & Enhancement**
   - Legacy 4/16-slice (~2–3 mm) → ~0.5 mm slice thickness & spatial resolution
   - Quality comparable to modern 256/320-slice; scalable to 512/640
   - Fraction of capex; cloud or hybrid

3) **MRI Imaging Super-Resolution & Enhancement**
   - 1.5T fast scans (~5×5×5 mm) → ~0.5×0.5×0.5 mm 3T/5T/7T-like
   - Maintain SNR and anatomical integrity with physics-informed priors
   - Throughput gains with shorter scan time + enhancement

4) **Digital Re-Staining for WSI (Pathology)**
   - Predict alternative stain protocols digitally (cytology, histology, IHC)
   - Reduce multi-stain costs; enable re-analysis of archived slides
   - Patient-centric: digital ownership and portability

Add a short “Executive context” block summarizing challenges (capex, lock-in, lifecycle).

## Technology Page
- Explain approach at a high level (no proprietary claims):
  - **GenAI**: DNNs + adversarial learning
  - **Physics-informed loss** to respect modality constraints
  - **OEM-agnostic training** via harmonization
  - **Uncertainty maps** & QA overlays
- Inline diagrams (SVG) and toggles for:
  - Denoise → Deblur → SR → Harmonize pipeline
  - Window/level examples

## Demos Page
- **Before/After X-Ray Slider**: use `react-compare-slider` component with `xray_before.jpg` vs `xray_after.jpg`
  - Controls: Window/Level sliders, Invert, “SR Strength” (0–100, applies postprocess sharpening + swap alt outputs)
- **CT & MRI Sliders**: same pattern with CT/MRI samples
- **DICOM Viewer**:
  - Drag-and-drop `.dcm` (single image or simple series)
  - Tools: zoom/pan, window/level, invert, reset, pixel readout, scale bar
- **Disclosure** banner: “Demo assets are synthetically generated or de-identified; results illustrative.”

## Pricing Page
- Tiers:
  - **Pay-Per-Use**: per-study pricing (placeholder numbers)
  - **Clinical**: committed volume discount, SSO, audit logs
  - **Enterprise/OEM**: on-prem/hybrid, custom SLAs, PHI segmentation
- FAQ accordion (latency, compliance, PACS integration, OEMs)

## Security & Compliance Page
- Content blocks: HIPAA readiness, GDPR, SOC2-ready posture, data residency, encryption in transit/at rest, access controls/logging, BAA availability. (Copy as placeholders, clearly marked “for demo”.)

## Docs Page
- “Edge Connector” (placeholder) + REST/HTTPS SaaS flow:
  - `POST /v1/enhance` with `modality`, `studyId`, file upload/multipart or URL
  - `GET /v1/jobs/:id` job status
  - Webhook schema for completion
- Example code snippets in TS/JS + cURL. Use mock responses.

## About & Contact
- Founding story, mission (upgrade via software)
- Contact form (React Hook Form + Zod; posts to a local mock API)
- Social links controlled via `site.config.ts`

## Login (stub)
- Email + magic link placeholder (no real auth; mock success toast)

## Dynamic Features
- Theme is always black; provide a “Pro color profile” toggle (cyan ↔ violet accent)
- Global SR Strength demo control (Zustand) synced across all sliders
- FPS and GPU info (small debug panel) hidden behind `?debug=1`

## Content (use/rewrite the following for site copy)
Use this content, condensed and web-friendly (no plagiarism). Place full version in `/content/executive-summary.md` and summarized bullets on pages:

Title: **Generative Artificial Intelligence Models for Medical Imaging SaaS**

Executive Summary (long in MD, short on pages):
- Medical imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI, pathology) is essential to clinical diagnostics. Hardware advances rapidly (e.g., pixel size improvements from ~500 µm to ~50 µm over ~25 years), creating pressure on centers with 10–15 year equipment lifecycles.
- OEM SaaS can help, but lock-in and varying quality remain challenges. **OEM-agnostic GenAI SaaS** offers a path to upgrade image quality without immediate capex.
- Use cases:
  - **X-Ray SR**: ~200 µm → ~50 µm DR-like.
  - **CT SR/Enhance**: 4/16-slice ~2–3 mm → ~0.5 mm equivalents, comparable to 256/320-slice systems, scalable.
  - **MRI SR/Enhance**: 1.5T ~5 mm³ → ~0.5 mm³ 3T/5T/7T-like.
  - **Digital Re-Staining (WSI)**: predict alternate stain protocols; reduce costs; enable archival & patient access.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Lazy-load 3D and heavy components
- Lighthouse 90+ (desktop), images optimized, code-split routes
- Keyboard/Screen reader friendly DICOM controls

## Mock API (local only)
- `/api/contact` POST → stores submissions in memory + logs
- `/api/demo-jobs` POST/GET → returns mocked job statuses for Docs examples

## Implementation Notes
- 3D Hero: build gantry with primitive geometry; lighting: rim + area lights; add Bloom & subtle film grain
- CompareSlider: accept `beforeSrc`, `afterSrc`, `modality`, `controls`
- DICOM viewer: simple single-viewport Cornerstone3D setup with tool toggles
- Add `SiteConfig` for brand name, nav, footer links, emails, social

## Scripts
- `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `lint`, `format`
- Husky pre-commit: `lint` + `format`

## Deliverables
- Fully running Vite app
- Clear README with setup/run/deploy steps (Replit & Vercel)
- Sample assets wired into Demos
- All copy populated from provided content (concise), full text in markdown

Now generate all files and code.
